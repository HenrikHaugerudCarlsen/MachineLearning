# MachineLearning - Fys-Stk3155/4155 - Project 2

### Groupmembers: Morten Tryti Berg, Henrik Haugerud Carlsen and Jonas RÃ¸nning


### Where to find what.
In the folder figs you will find the figures presented in the rapport. 

The programming tasks were completed in the jupyter notebook files. You can find the code for linear regression in the linear regression.ipynb file, and the code for the logistic regression in the file logistic regression.ipynb. Moreover every result with a single hidden layer being used can be calculated or found with the file singlehidden.ipynb and for multiplayered FFNN the file General Neuron.ipynb was used. The later file can also handle a single hidden layer, but we have seperated thise so that we could make data with the single hidden layer network while we generalised the codes. 



### Rapport
The rapport which we count as our "delivery" is named rapport2.pdf and should be the only pdf file in this repository.
