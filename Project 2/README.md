### Groupmembers: Morten Tryti Berg, Henrik Haugerud Carlsen, Jonas RÃ¸nning


### Where to find what.
In the folder figs you will find the figures presented in the rapport. 

The programming tasks were completed in the jupyter notebook files. You can find the code for task a in task a.ipynb, the code for task b in task b.ipynb and so on. Moreover every result with a single hidden layer being used can be calculated or found with the file singlehidden.ipynb and for multiplayered FFNN the file General Neuron.ipynb was used.



### Rapport
The rapport which we count as our "delivery" is named rapport2.pdf and should be the only pdf file in this repository.
